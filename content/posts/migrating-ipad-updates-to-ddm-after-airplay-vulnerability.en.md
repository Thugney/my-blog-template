## The Problem

CVE-2025-24252 dropped - an AirPlay vulnerability that lets attackers on the local network corrupt process memory. Apple patched it in iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 17.7.6.

We were still using the old MDM-based software update policies. These are deprecated and don't give you the control DDM (Declarative Device Management) offers.

Time to fix that.

## Environment

- Microsoft Intune
- iPads (mixed generations)
- Entra ID groups

## What I Did

### 1. Organized iPads into Groups

First, I needed visibility. Created 3 dynamic groups based on iPad generation:

**Group 1: Older iPads (6th-7th gen)**

```
(device.deviceModel -contains "iPad7") or (device.deviceModel -contains "iPad6")
```

**Group 2: Mid-range iPads (8th-9th gen)**

```
(device.deviceModel -contains "iPad12") or (device.deviceModel -contains "iPad13")
```

**Group 3: Newer iPads (10th gen+)**

```
(device.deviceModel -contains "iPad14")
```

Go to **Entra ID** → **Groups** → **New group** → **Dynamic device** → Add your rule.

### 2. Found Devices That Couldn't Update

iPad 5th generation can't get iOS 17.7.6 or 18.4. These are stuck on iOS 16 - no patch available.

To find them:

1. Go to **Intune** → **Devices** → **All devices**
2. Filter by OS version and model
3. Export the list

Any iPad 5th gen (model A1822, A1823) needs replacement. No way around it.

### 3. Created DDM Update Policy

DDM gives you more control than the old MDM policies. Here's what I configured:

1. Go to **Intune** → **Devices** → **Manage updates** → **Apple updates** → **Create profile**
2. Select **iOS/iPadOS** and **Settings catalog**
3. Add **Declarative Device Management** → **Software Update**

**Settings I used:**

| Setting | Pilot Group | Production |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Target OS Version | Latest | Latest |
| Install deadline | Immediate | 7 days |
| Notifications | Show all | Show all |

### 4. Rolled Out in Phases

**Week 1:** Pilot group - immediate deadline, watch for issues.

**Week 2:** Production - 7-day deadline so users have time to save work and charge devices.

## What to Watch Out For

- **iPad 5th gen and older** - Can't update. Replace them.
- **Battery level** - iPads need 50%+ battery or be plugged in to install updates.
- **Storage** - Some updates need 2-3GB free space. Users with full devices will fail.
