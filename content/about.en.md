## Hi, I'm Robel

Microsoft 365 Security Specialist at Modum Kommune in Norway. I manage security and compliance for 4,000+ users and 6,000+ endpoints.

Originally from Eritrea, I started in IT support back in 2009. After relocating to Norway and working as a social worker with refugee youth, I returned to IT as an apprentice in 2021 and transitioned to full-time M365 security work in 2024.

### What I Work With

- **Defender** - Threat protection and security operations
- **Entra ID** - Identity and conditional access
- **Intune** - Device management and compliance
- **Autopilot** - Windows provisioning
- **Purview** - Data governance and sensitivity labels
- **PowerShell** - Automation and scripting

### This Blog

Real scenarios, real solutions. I document the problems I encounter and how I fix them - partly as my own reference, partly to help others facing the same issues.

### Eriteach YouTube

I also run the [Eriteach YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@eriteach) with how-to tutorials and tech content.
